## Basic Usage

For more information on how to add one of the themes in your project, refer to the following articles:

* [Using the Kendo UI themes in Angular Projects](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/styling/)
* [Using the Kendo UI themes in React Projects](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/styling/)
* [Using the Kendo UI themes in Vue Projects](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-vue-ui/components/styling/)
* [Using the Kendo UI themes in jQuery Projects](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/styles-and-layout/sass-themes)

## Development

The styles are split into components and the dependencies are managed by the [`import-once`](scss/mixins/core/_import-once.scss) mixin. When you configure the styles, define them within an `import-once` block. In this way, when required from multiple files, they are bundled once.

During development, the SCSS files are linted on every `commit` and built on every `push` command. To test the theme package against a component, link the theme in the components package.

Browser-specific properties are generated at build-time through the [PostCSS autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).

### Working with This Monorepo

The repository uses [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/) to ship the multiple theme packages from a single Git repository. For details why this is a good idea for the themes, see [this issue](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-theme-default/issues/720).

To set up the monorepo:

Run the `build/install.sh` file. To do that, on the root level of the repository, run the following row in a Git Bash:

  > `./build/install.sh`

To perform a clean setup (remove existing node_modules) of the monorepo, on the root level of the repository, run the following row in a Git Bash:

  > `./build/clean-install.sh`

The following commands have to be run in the root of the repository and help you check if various tasks are accomplished successfully:

* To lint over all the themes, run `npm run lint`.
* To build all the themes, run `npm run build`.
* To run the lint, JS, and build tests, run `npm test`.
* To run builds on every file change of a specific theme:

  * Change the working directory in the terminal to the specific theme. For example, `cd packages/bootstrap` will change to the bootstrap theme.
  * Run `npm run watch`. This will start a process that will listen for changes and build the theme, whenever a file is changed.

Changes in the `develop` branch release a new package version on the `dev` channel and in the `(version)-dev.(hash)` format. To install the latest development version of a given theme, run `npm install (themename)@dev`&mdash;for example, `npm install @progress/kendo-theme-default@dev`.

### Visual tests

To guard against regressions and make pull request reviews easier, the CI build makes screenshots of the sample pages in `tests/visual/*.html`. This happens automatically for all feature branches. The sample pages contain static HTML that is the recommended rendering for components that use the theme.

To generate screenshots for a specific theme:

1. Build the theme with `npm run build`
1. Run `npm run create-screenshots <theme>`, substituting `<theme>` with a theme name.

These steps will create new screenshots in `tests/output`. Note that due to platform differences, all of the files will be marked as changed.


### Embedding Resources

To avoid hosting-related issues in projects that use the themes, the resources are embedded by encoding them in the output CSS. For more details, refer to [this issue](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-theme-default/issues/41#issuecomment-258472183).

To embed the latest resources in a given theme:

1. Run the `npm run embed-assets` task in the theme subfolder. The task generates a file with the same name which registers a Base64-encoded version in the `$data-uris` SCSS map. For example, the `foo.woff` font file will be encoded in a `foo.scss` file which can later be imported through `@import './font/foo';`.
1. Inline the encoded file inside the CSS through `map-get( $data-uris, 'foo.woff' )`. For example:

    ```scss
    @font-face {
        font-family: 'WebComponentsIcons';
        src: url(map-get( $data-uris, 'WebComponentsIcons.woff' )) format( "woff" );
    }
    ```

### Documenting Variables

The available variables for customizing each theme are listed in the article on customization for each theme (`docs/customization.md`) The file is generated from the SCSS source files by running the `npm run api` command.

To document a variable, use triple-slash comments (`///`) before its definition.

    /// Variable description
    $foo: 42 !default;

To group variables, use the `@group` directive.

    /// Variable description
    /// @group random
    $foo: 42 !default;

    /// Another variable description
    /// @group random
    $bar: 1024 !default;

To change the layout or the front meter of the generated help topic, change the `build/customization.md.hbs` source file.
