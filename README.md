* [Using the Kendo UI themes in Blazor](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/themes/overview)

## Development

The styles are split into components and the dependencies are managed by the [`import-once`](scss/mixins/core/_import-once.scss) mixin. When you configure the styles, define them within an `import-once` block. In this way, when required from multiple files, they are bundled once.

During development, the SCSS files are linted on every `commit` and built on every `push` command. To test the theme package against a component, link the theme in the components package.

Browser-specific properties are generated at build-time through the [PostCSS autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).

### Working with This Monorepo

The repository uses [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/) to ship the multiple theme packages from a single Git repository. For details why this is a good idea for the themes, see [this issue](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-theme-default/issues/720).

To set up the monorepo:

Just run `npm install` in the root directory. Using node hooks, the command will clean the repo, install it and link the files.

The following commands have to be run in the root of the repository and help you check if various tasks are accomplished successfully:

* To lint over all the themes, run `npm run lint`.
* To build all the themes with node-sass, run `npm run sass`.
* To build all the themes with dart-sass, run `npm run dart`.
* To run the lint, JS, and build tests, run `npm test`.
* To run builds on every file change of a specific theme:

  * Change the working directory in the terminal to the specific theme. For example, `cd packages/bootstrap` will change to the bootstrap theme.
  * Run `npm run watch`. This will start a process that will listen for changes and build the theme, whenever a file is changed.

Changes in the `develop` branch release a new package version on the `dev` channel and in the `(version)-dev.(hash)` format. To install the latest development version of a given theme, run `npm install (themename)@dev`&mdash;for example, `npm install @progress/kendo-theme-default@dev`.

### Visual tests

To guard against regressions and make pull request reviews easier, the CI build makes screenshots of the sample pages in `tests/visual/*.html`. This happens automatically for all feature branches. The sample pages contain static HTML that is the recommended rendering for components that use the theme.

To generate screenshots for a specific theme:

1. Build the theme with `npm run sass` or `npm run dart`
1. Run `npm run create-screenshots <theme>`, substituting `<theme>` with a theme name.

These steps will create new screenshots in `tests/output`. Note that due to platform differences, all of the files will be marked as changed.


### Embedding Resources

To avoid hosting-related issues in projects that use the themes, the resources are embedded by encoding them in the output CSS. For more details, refer to [this issue](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-theme-default/issues/41#issuecomment-258472183).

To embed the latest resources:

1. Run the `npm run embed-assets` task. The task generates a file with the same name which registers a Base64-encoded version in the `$data-uris` SCSS map. For example, the `foo.woff` font file will be encoded in a `foo.scss` file which can later be imported through `@import './font/foo';`.
1. Inline the encoded file inside the CSS through `map-get( $data-uris, 'foo.woff' )`. For example:

    ```scss
    @font-face {
        font-family: 'WebComponentsIcons';
        src: url(map-get( $data-uris, 'WebComponentsIcons.woff' )) format( "woff" );
    }
    ```

### Documenting Variables

The available variables for customizing each theme are listed in the article on customization for each theme (`docs/customization.md`) The file is generated from the SCSS source files by running the `npm run api` command.

To document a variable, use triple-slash comments (`///`) before its definition.

    /// Variable description
    $foo: 42 !default;

To group variables, use the `@group` directive.

    /// Variable description
    /// @group random
    $foo: 42 !default;

    /// Another variable description
    /// @group random
    $bar: 1024 !default;

To change the layout or the front meter of the generated help topic, change the `build/customization.md.hbs` source file.
