## Managing Focus

All of the buttons in the group are focusable by default, and follow the regular tab order of the page.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `Tab`| Focuses the next button in the group. If Focus is on the last button, focuses the next focusable element on the page. |
| `Shfit + Tab`| Focuses to the previous button in the group. If focus is on the first button, focus the previous focusable element before the ButtonGorup. |
| `Enter/Space`| Triggers a click action on the button |
