# ListView Keyboard Support

## Managing Focus

The ListView is a templated component, and as such doesn't have any rendering of itself. Thus, no internal keyboard navigation is provided.
Focus moves through the focusable elements of the item template.
The `Pager` component is focusable, and it's actions are described in the `Pager.md` keyboard navigation specification.
