# Map Keyboard Support

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The main map element is focusable by `Tab`. Pressing `Tab` again moves to the next focusable element on the page (might be the attribution or an element outside of the map). The navigator and zoom controls are not directly focusable - their functionality is covered by pressing keys when the focus is on the main map element, otherwise their behavior is like buttons.

| Shortcut          | Behavior                      |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| ArrowUp           | Scrolls (pans) the map up.    |
| ArrowDown         | Scrolls (pans) the map down.  |
| ArrowLeft         | Scrolls (pans) the map left.  |
| ArrowRight        | Scrolls (pans) the map right. |
| Plus/NumpadPlus   | Zoom in.                      |
| Minus/NumpadMinus | Zoom out.                     |
