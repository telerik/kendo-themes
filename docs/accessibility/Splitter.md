## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut         | Behavior |
|:-                |:-        |
| `Up Arrow`         | Moves up the split-bar in a vertical Splitter.    |
| `Down Arrow`       | Moves down a split-bar in a vertical Splitter.    |
| `Left Arrow`       | Moves left a split-bar in a horizontal Splitter.  |
| `Right Arrow`      | Moves right a split-bar in a horizontal Splitter. |
| `Enter`            | Toggles the collapsed state of the nearest collapsible pane. |
| `Tab`              | The key that allows focusing a splitter bar |

**Note 1:** The "splitter bar/split-bar" is the section between two panes that allows collapsing/resizing.

**Note 2:** Splitter bars can be expanded/collapsed when double clicked apart from clicking on the expand/collapse icon element. Double-clicking (or `Enter` key) toggles the closest collapsible pane (left pane has priority over right pane if both are collapsible).
