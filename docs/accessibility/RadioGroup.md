# RadioGroup Keyboard Support

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The radio group does not implement any keyboard navigation. Everything is handled through the default browser behavior for radio buttons.

| Shortcut | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `Space` | Toggles checked state |
| `Up/Left` | Moves focus to previous button and selects it. If first button is focused, moves focus to the last. |
| `Down/Right` | Moves focus to next button and selects it. If last button is focused, moves focus to the first. |
