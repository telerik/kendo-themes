# SVG Icons (Scalable Vector Graphics)
As of the R3 2020 release, Kendo UI delivers more than 500 [SVG icons].

> Currently the predefined set of SVG icons can be used with the [Kendo UI for Angular SVG Icon component]({% slug overview_svgicon %}) only.

## What Are SVG Icons
SVG icons are vector images defined in XML format. They are basically blocks of XML tags and allow vector graphics to be displayed into a webpage

## Why Use SVG Icons
If vector graphics should be displayed within a webpage, there are some options - two of those options are [font icons]({% slug icons %}) and SVG icons.

The main benefits of using SVG icons are in terms of:

* Rendering / Scalability - they are treated by the browsers as images, so anti-aliasing issues are avoided. This ensures that SVG icons are sharp at all resolutions, without losing quality;
* Flexibility - individual parts of an SVG icon can be controlled via CSS (font-size, color, animation). There are also SVG-specific CSS filters and stroke properties. Multi-color SVG icons are supported;
* Accessibility - using semantic elements and attributes (such as `<title>`, `<desc>`, `aria-labelledby` etc.) makes them accessible to screen readers, search engines and other devices.

## Basic Usage

To use the Kendo UI SVG icons, please check the [Kendo UI for Angular SVG Icon component]({% slug overview_svgicon %}).
