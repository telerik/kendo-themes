# Radio Button

A radio button is one type of selection indicator in a list of options. Only one option may be selected at any time.

Radio Buttons may render the following content:

## Sizes

Radio Buttons can have various sizes. Use the smaller ones to create a compact theme or the larger ones on mobile devices.
```html
<div class="k-d-flex k-gap-2">
    <input
        type="radio"
        class="k-radio k-radio-sm k-roundend-md"
    />
    <input
        type="radio"
        class="k-radio k-radio-md k-roundend-md"
    />
    <input
        type="radio"
        class="k-radio k-radio-lg k-roundend-md"
    />
</div>
```

> Note: When a radio is placed inside a label and the `size` is set differently than `medium`, the `line-height` of the `.k-radio-label` class has to be adjusted.
