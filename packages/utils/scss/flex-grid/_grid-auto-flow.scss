/// This is equivalent to `grid-auto-flow: row;`. Items are placed by filling each row in turn, adding new rows as necessary. If neither row nor column is provided, row is assumed.
/// @example grid-auto-flow: row;
/// @name .k-grid-auto-flow-row
/// @group grid-auto-flow
/// @contextType css

/// This is equivalent to `grid-auto-flow: column;`. Items are placed by filling each column in turn, adding new columns as necessary.
/// @example grid-auto-flow: column;
/// @name .k-grid-auto-flow-column
/// @group grid-auto-flow
/// @contextType css

/// This is equivalent to `grid-auto-flow: dense;`. Items are placed by a packing algorithm that attempts to fill in holes earlier in the grid, if smaller items come up later. This may cause items to appear out-of-order, when doing so would fill in holes left by larger items. If it is omitted, a "sparse" algorithm is used, where the placement algorithm only ever moves "forward" in the grid when placing items, never backtracking to fill holes. This ensures that all of the auto-placed items appear "in order", even if this leaves holes that could have been filled by later items.
