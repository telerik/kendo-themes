/// @name .k-pointer-events-none
/// @description This is equivalent to `pointer-events: none;`. The element is never the target of pointer events; however, pointer events may target its descendant elements if those descendants have pointer-events set to some other value. In these circumstances, pointer events will trigger event listeners on this parent element as appropriate on their way to/from the descendant during the event capture/bubble phases.
/// @group pointer-events

/// @name .k-pointer-events-auto
/// @description This is equivalent to `pointer-events: auto;`. The element behaves as it would if the pointer-events property were not specified. In SVG content, this value and the value visiblePainted have the same effect.
/// @group pointer-events
