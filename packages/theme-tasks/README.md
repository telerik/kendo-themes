# Kendo UI Theme Tasks

The Kendo UI `theme-tasks` package is a utility library for developing and building `@progress/kendo-theme-*` packages.

## Installation

`theme-tasks` is tightly coupled with the Kendo UI themes. Therefore, even though it is possible to install it as a standalone library, currently it is hardly usable as such.
