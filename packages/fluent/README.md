## Quick start

Kendo UI Fluent Theme is available as an npm package.

If you don't need to apply any [customization](#customizing) to the theme, you can can reference the precompiled CSS directly from unpkg CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@progress/kendo-theme-fluent/dist/all.css" />
```

While using the pre-compiled CSS file is faster than compiling the theme from the source code, the approach has the two drawbacks: it includes CSS for all components; it does not provide options for theme customization through SCSS variables (which is possible when you build the theme from the source code) because the theme is already compiled.

If you prefer, or you need to customize the theme, you can install it:

```sh
npm install --save @progress/kendo-theme-fluent
```

and then import it in your project styles:

```scss
// Import the entire theme
@use "~@progress/kendo-theme-fluent/scss/all.scss";
```

## Importing

In your custom scss file, you can import the entirety of the theme, by importing `scss/all.scss` or pick just the styles for the components you need. The files for individual components:

```scss
// Import only Button and Grid styles
@use "~@progress/kendo-theme-fluent/scss/index.scss" as kendo-theme;

@include kendo-theme.config(
    $components: (
        "button",
        "grid"
    )
);
@include kendo-theme.styles();
```

## SCSS Variables Customization

The Kendo UI Fluent theme enables customization through SCSS variables as follows:

```scss
@use "index.scss" as kendo-theme with (
    $kendo-body-bg: beige,
    $kendo-font-size: 1rem
);

@include kendo-theme.config();
@include kendo-theme.styles();
```

or:

```scss
@use "index.scss" as kendo-theme;

kendo-theme.$kendo-body-bg: beige;
kendo-theme.$kendo-font-size: 30px;

@include kendo-theme.config();
@include kendo-theme.styles();
```

## CSS Variables Customization

The theme is also making use of CSS custom properties in its compiled output for runtime customization. This eliminates the need to recompile the theme from the source.

### Root variables

The theme exposes global [root variables](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-themes/blob/develop/packages/fluent/scss/core/_variables.scss#L106-L133) that can be used anywhere on the page to dynamically customize the theme:

```css
body {
    --kendo-font-size: 1.2rem;
}
```

### Component variables

The theme also exposes CSS variables for all components and allows dynamic restyling:

```css
.k-button-solid-primary {
    --kendo-button-text: #fff;
    --kendo-button-bg: #28a745;
    --kendo-button-border: #28a745;

    --kendo-button-hover-text: #fff;
    --kendo-button-hover-bg: #218838;
    --kendo-button-hover-border: #218838;

    --kendo-button-focus-text: #fff;
    --kendo-button-focus-bg: #28a745;
    --kendo-button-focus-border: #28a745;

    --kendo-button-active-text: #fff;
    --kendo-button-active-bg: #1e7e34;
    --kendo-button-active-border: #1e7e34;
}
```
