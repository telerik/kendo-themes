## Quick start

Kendo UI Fluent Theme is available as an npm package.

If you don't need to apply any [customization](#customizing) to the theme, you can can reference the precompiled CSS directly from unpkg CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@progress/kendo-theme-fluent/dist/all.css" />
```

While using the pre-compiled CSS file is faster than compiling the theme from the source code, the approach has the two drawbacks: it includes CSS for all components; it does not provide options for theme customization through SCSS variables (which is possible when you build the theme from the source code) because the theme is already compiled.

If you prefer, or you need to customize the theme, you can install it:

```sh
npm install --save @progress/kendo-theme-fluent
```

and then import it in your project styles:

```scss
// Import the entire theme
@import "~@progress/kendo-theme-fluent/dist/all.scss";
```

## Customizing

You can customize Kendo UI Fluent Theme both in terms of what gets compiled and how the theme will look.

### Importing

In your custom scss file, you can import the entirety of the theme, by importing `dist/all.scss` or pick just the styles for the components you need. The files for individual components are in `scss/` folder:

```scss
// Import only PanelBar and Grid styles
@import "~@progress/kendo-theme-fluent/scss/panelbar/_index.scss";
@import "~@progress/kendo-theme-fluent/scss/grid/_index.scss";
```
