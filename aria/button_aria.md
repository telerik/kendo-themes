## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-button` | `role=button` or `nodeName=button` | If the used element is not `<button>`, explicitly set its `role` to `button`. |
