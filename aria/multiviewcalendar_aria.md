## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

### MultiViewCalendar Grid


The element wrapping the tables in the component should follow the requirements for the `grid` role (https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#grid).

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-calendar-view` | `role=grid` | Specifies the role of the Calendar dates table. |
|  | `aria-labelledby` | Pointing to the `k-calendar-title` element (e.g. `March 2022 - April 2022`). |
|  | `aria-activedescendant=.k-calendar-td.k-focus id` | Pointing to the currently active (focused) date/month/year/decade cell in the table. |
|  | `tabindex=0` | Makes the grid focusable. |
| `.k-calendar-table` | `role=none` | All `k-calendar-table` elements must have their role set to `none`. That is because their content must be made belonging to a single `grid` component. |
| `.k-content:first-of-type>.k-calendar-head` | `role=rowgroup` | The first `k-calendar-thead` must explicitly have its role set to `rowgroup` as its semantics has been removed while setting its `<table>` role to `none`. |
| `.k-calendar-tbody` | `role=rowgroup` | The `k-calendar-tbody` elements must explicitly have their roles set to `rowgroup` as their semantics have been removed while setting their `<table>` elements role to `none`. |
| `.k-content:first-of-type>.k-calendar-head>.k-calendar-tr,.k-calendar-head>.k-calendar-tr` | `role=row` | The `k-calendar-tr` elements must explicitly have their roles set to `row` as their semantics have been removed while setting their `<table>` elements role to `none`. Does not apply for fully empty rows, header rows after the first month, and initial data rows in Month views after the first month that have at least one cell missing |
| `.k-content:first-of-type>.k-calendar-head>.k-calendar-tr>.k-calendar-th` | `role=columnheader` | The `k-calendar-th` elements must explicitly have their roles set to `columnheader` as their semantics have been removed while setting their `<table>` elements role to `none`. |
|  | `scope=col` | Specifies that the header is applied to a column. |
|  | `aria-label` | Specifies the full name of the day of the week (the column header). |
| `.k-calendar-td:not(.k-out-of-range)` | `role=gridcell` | The cells must explicitly have their roles set to `gridcell` as their semantics have been removed while setting their `<table>` elements role to `none`. |
|  | `aria-label ` or `title` | Applicable in year view - for better context contains the full name of the month. May also be applied in month view to specify the full text for a date. |
| `.k-calendar-td.k-selected` | `aria-selected` | Specifies whether the date is selected or not. |
| `.k-calendar-td.k-disabled` | `aria-disabled` | When a date is not available for selection, its gridcell element must have the attribute set to `true`. |
| `.k-content:first-of-type>.k-calendar-tbody>.k-calendar-tr:first-of-type>.k-out-of-range` | `role=gridcell` | The cells must explicitly have their roles set to `gridcell` as their semantics have been removed while setting their `<table>` elements role to `none`. |

### Button and Link elements

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-prev-view,.k-next-view` | `tabindex=-1` | The buttons must not be focusable. |
| `.k-calendar-title` | `tabindex=-1` | The button must not be focusable. |
| `.k-nav-today` | `tabindex=-1` | The link must not be focusable. |
