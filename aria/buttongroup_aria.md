## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-button-group:not(.k-split-button)` | `role=group` | Sets the proper role for the group of buttons. |
| `.k-button-group.k-disabled` | `aria-disabled=true` | The attribute is rendered only when the entire button group is disabled. |
| `.k-button-group:not(.k-split-button):not(.k-scheduler-navigation):not(.k-zoom-control) .k-button` | `aria-pressed` | Specifies the current state of the ButtonGroup. Only the selected button within the group will have this attribute set to `true`. |
