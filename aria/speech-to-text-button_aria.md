## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-button.k-speech-to-text-button` | `role=button` or `nodeName=button` | If the used element is not `<button>`, explicitly set its `role` to `button`. |
|  | `aria-pressed=true/false` | Announced the toggle behaviour of the button. |
